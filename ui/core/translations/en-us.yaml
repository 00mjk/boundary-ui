  descriptions:
    user: A User inherits from Principal ("is-a" Principal) allowing it to be associated with zero or more Roles.
    users: A user is any entity authorized to access Boundary using authentication credentials specific to one of the configured Authentication Methods. A User is owned by one and only one Organization. A User is associated with zero or one Authentication Methods. A User not associated with an Authentication Method can not log in to the system. A User can belong to zero or more Groups. A User is deleted when the Organization it belongs to is deleted. The lifecycle of a User is not tied to the lifecycle of any Authentication Method, Group or Role, but rather to its Organization only.
    role: A Role can be assigned to zero or more Principals. A Principal assigned a Role receives all capabilities granted by any Direct Grant owned by the Role. A Role is deleted when the Scope it belongs to is deleted. All Direct Grants owned by a Role are deleted when the Role is deleted.
    roles: A role is a collection of capabilities granted to any Principal the Role is assigned to. A Role belongs to one and only one Scope. A Role owns zero or more Direct Grants. The lifecycle of a Role is not tied to the lifecycle of any Principal.
    grants: A grant represents a set of capabilities granted to a role. It couples a set of Actions to either a set of Resource Types or an individual Resource. A Direct Grant belongs exclusively to one and only one Role. However, equivalent Direct Grants may exist across different Roles. A Direct Grant references one or more Actions and either one or more Resource types or one specific Resource. A Direct Grant is deleted when the Role it belongs to is deleted. A Direct Grant is also deleted if it is associated with a specific Resource and that Resource itself is deleted. The lifecycle of a Direct Grant is not tied to the lifecycle of any Action or Resource Type.
    principals: A principal is any entity which can be assigned capabilities. Principal is abstract. User, Group, and Project are concrete Principals. A Principal can be assigned to zero or more Roles.
    group: All Users in a Group are granted the capabilities of all Roles the Group is associated with. A Group is deleted when the Scope it belongs to is deleted.
    groups: Groups are collections of Users used only for access control purposes. A Group is owned by one and only one Scope. A Group can contain zero or more Users. A Group inherits from Principal ("is-a" Principal) allowing it to be associated with zero or more Roles. The lifecycle of a Group is not tied to the lifecycle of any User or Role.
    org: When an Organization is deleted, all resources owned by it are also deleted.
    orgs: An Organization is a top-level container, and owns zero to many Projects and zero to many Authentication Methods. An Organization inherits from Scope ("is-a" Scope) allowing it to own zero to many Groups, Roles, Targets, or Host Catalogs. The lifecycle of an Organization is not tied to anything else. A Role at the Organization level can grant permissions at the Project level.
    project: When a Project is deleted, all resources owned by it are also deleted. The lifecycle of a Project is not tied to any resource it contains.
    projects: A project is a child scope of an organization and is owned by an Organization. A Project inherits from Scope ("is-a" Scope) allowing it to own zero to many Groups, Roles, Targets, or Host Catalogs. A Project also inherits from Principal ("is-a" Principal) allowing it to be associated with zero or more Roles. A Project has no additional relationships beyond those defined in Scope and Principal. A Project is deleted when the Organization it belongs to is deleted.
    host-catalog: A host catalog is a permission boundary modeled as a container.
    host-catalogs: A host catalog is a permission boundary modeled as a container.
    auth-method: An Authentication Method creates and references zero or more Users. An Authentication Method is deleted when the Organization it belongs to is deleted. The lifecycle of an Authentication Method is not tied to the lifecycle of any User.
    auth-methods: An authentication method is a method configured for an Organization to authenticate Users. An Authentication Method is owned by one and only one Organization.
    host-set: Host Set is abstract. A Host Set is deleted when the Host Catalog it belongs to is deleted.
    host-sets: A host set is a resource which provides a subset of Hosts from the set of Hosts of the Host Catalog it belongs to. A Host Set belongs to one and only one Host Catalog. A Host Set can contain zero or more Hosts. A Host Set can be contained by zero or more Targets. The lifecycle of a Host Set is not tied to the lifecycle of any Targets or Hosts.
    host: Host is abstract. A Host is deleted when the Host Catalog it belongs to is deleted.
    hosts: A host is a computing element with a network address reachable from Boundary. A Host belongs to one and only one Host Catalog. A Host can be contained by zero or more Host Sets. The lifecycle of a Host is not tied to the lifecycle of any Host Sets.
    target: Target is abstract. A Target is deleted when the Scope it belongs to is deleted.
    targets: A target is a networked service a User can connect to and interact with through Boundary. A Target does not directly contain any secrets. A Target contains a collection of Hosts. A Target belongs to one and only one Scope. A Target can contain zero or more Host Sets. The lifecycle of a Target is not tied to the lifecycle of any Host Set.
